# team-profile-generator

## Description

This project generates a webpage that displays a team's members as cards. These cards include basic info such as a name, id number, email, and role. There are three possible roles to assign to a team member, which include manager, engineer, and intern.

This application uses Jest to run unit test, and Inquirer to collect user input.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the instructions to download.

Then install the inquirer npm package in your command line using the following command:

` $ npm install `

To install Jest to run the unit tests, type into your comman line:

` $ npm install --save-dev jest `

## Usage

Open the folder in integrated terminal by right clicking and selecting the drop down option.

In the terminal run `npm test` to see if the test suite passes, and then run `node index.js` to start the program.

You will then be prompted with a series of questions pertaining to the members of your team. This line of questioning will continue until you select 'No more employees to add'.
